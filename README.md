# CF-MVGC

Multi-view clustering of remote sensing data plays a vital role in Earth observation analysis. Recently, deep graph clustering methods based on contrastive learning have significantly improved feature representation capabilities. However, most existing approaches treat all views equally, neglecting the inherent uniqueness and heterogeneity across views, which often results in two major issues: 1) discriminative features from clustering-friendly views are underexplored; and 2) redundant or noisy information from less informative views can degrade the shared representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-view graph clustering framework termed CF-MVGC for remote sensing data, which dynamically preserves discriminative features and suppresses redundancy by assessing view affinity. Specifically, we employ a dual-stage representation learning strategy to extract both view-specific discriminative features and cross-view consistent representations. To further exploit and adaptively integrate complementary information across views, we design a progressive feature filtering model that dynamically evaluates view affinity using two novel metrics, i.e., view fidelity index (VFI) and view criticality index (VCI). Based on these assessments, the module adaptively modulates feature update and reset signals, reinforcing informative views while suppressing noisy or redundant ones. Views with high affinity receive strengthened update signals to retain valuable features, while those with low affinity are subjected to enhanced reset operations to eliminate noise and redundancy. The resulting high-quality, discriminative representations lead to improved clustering performance, establishing a positive feedback loop. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CF-MVGC against its competitors.
